## ðŸ“š About the project

This project is a simple and modular Node.js API built with Express.js, designed to dynamically generate and serve various types of images through different endpoints. It demonstrates how to handle HTTP requests, manage parameters, and perform image processing efficiently.

The API provides the following features:

- Placeholder Generator â€” Creates customizable placeholder images based on width and height.

- Gradient Generator â€” Generates gradient backgrounds using two colors and an orientation (axis).

- Avatar Generator â€” Produces personalized avatars from a given name.

- QR Code Generator â€” Converts text into scannable QR codes.

- Meme Generator â€” Adds top and bottom text to an existing image to create memes.

Each feature is handled by a dedicated route, making the code easy to maintain and extend.
Environment variables (via Dotenv) are used to configure the server port and other potential settings securely.
